### Hey!

I'm someone who is passionate about **GNU/Linux** and likes to **write code**.

<br>

I mostly write **Rust** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

Other than that, here are a few interesting **projects** (written in **C**, **Go**, **Python**, **Js**) that worth mentioning:

I [maintain](https://archlinux.org/packages/) a handful of packages for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), including some popular **Rust** software. I also contribute to [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) and various other open source projects through this voluntary work.

I sometimes write [blog](https://blog.com) posts and occasionally [tweet](https://twitter.com/m3ctury) about stuff. 

If you want to support my work, consider [becoming a patron](https://patreon.com/join/mectury) on **Patreon**. Unfortunately, GitHub Sponsors is not _supported_ in my region.
